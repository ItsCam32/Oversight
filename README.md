<h2>Description</h2>
Oversight is a 3D aerial defence shooter created as a solo project for a final year University project in Unreal Engine 5, using Blueprints and C++, harnessing the power of Lumen, Nanite, with a hand-built environment created with AAA assets from the Quixel Megascan Library. The Objective of the game is to use the multiple fire systems and abilities onboard the gunship to eliminate the enemy AI on the ground, avert and destroy missile sites that are targeting you, before defending the hostages from re-engaging hostiles and escorting them to the extraction zone.
